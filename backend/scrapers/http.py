"""
Shared HTTP client with exponential backoff.

Every scraper here talks to a third-party endpoint that rate-limits. Without a
retry layer a 429 arrives as an ordinary response whose body parses to zero
results, and callers read that as "no more jobs" — the scan truncates silently
and nothing in the logs says why.

`get`/`post` are drop-in replacements for `requests.get`/`requests.post`: they
return the final Response (so existing `status_code != 200` checks keep
working) and only raise when every attempt raised, exactly as requests does
today. What they add is retrying the statuses that mean "ask again later".
