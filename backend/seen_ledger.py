"""
Permanent record of every job the scanner has ever surfaced.

The `jobs` table is a working queue, not a history: `purge_visited_jobs` and
`purge_stale_discovered_jobs` delete rows out of it on every scan. Dedup that
consults only that table therefore forgets, and the next scan happily re-adds
the jobs it just removed - the user sees the same posting they already opened,
scan after scan.

This ledger outlives those purges. It answers one question - "have we already
dealt with this posting?" - and separates two cases:

  * BLOCKING statuses are decisions the user made about that specific job:
    they opened it, applied to it, or dismissed it. Never show it again.
  * Non-blocking statuses ("seen", "filtered", "discovered", "expired",
    "cleared") are observability. Hard filters re-run cheaply on every scan, so
    a job rejected by a filter is recorded with its reason but is free to come
    back if the filters change — and ageing out of the queue or being tidied
    off the dashboard are not decisions about the job at all.
